	â€¢	rate: Exchange rate between token_a and token_b.

2. Public Functions

	â€¢	initialize(account: &signer, token_a: address, token_b: address, rate: u64): Initializes the swap contract with two token addresses and a specified exchange rate.
	â€¢	swap(account: &signer, amount_a: u64): Swaps amount_a of token_a for an equivalent amount of token_b based on the exchange rate.
	â€¢	get_rate(account: address): u64: Retrieves the exchange rate for the swap contract.
